This replaces the Slackware package

## from the trinity desktop website, installation instructions ##

libart-lgpl is another dependency package that the Trinity Project has taken over after it was dropped by its original maintainer, because it needed several patches to prevent crashes.

This version of libart provided by the Trinity Project includes those patches and is intended to be a replacement for any version of libart currently installed by any distro.

Build this patched version of libart and replace the stock libart installed with the distro.

## Re: PACKAGING:

"""
The plugins are designed for being packaged and installed separately of akodelib.

Take especially note of the following:
- Do not install mpeg_decoder if you have software patent concerns
- Do not install src_resampler and mpeg_decoder if you want a pure LGPL library since they are both derived of GPL libraries.
- If you wish to install plugins in a non-standard place, you can change the AKODE_SEARCHDIR definition in lib/pluginhandler.cpp.
- You SHOULD not install sinks for backends you don't use. Thus jack_sink should only be installed when jackd is available, pulse_sink only when the PulseAudio server is used and alsa_sink only when using a Linux kernel with ALSA drivers.

  When using direct aKode playback sinks will be autodetected by loading and probing plugins in this order: pulse, jack, alsa, oss

---------------------
Attempting to build FFMPEG_DECODER was abandoned because the akode code is too old.

Example:
/tmp/build/tmp-akode/akode-trinity-14.0.7/akode/plugins/ffmpeg_decoder/ffmpeg_decoder.cpp:98:17: error: ‘AVCODEC_MAX_AUDIO_FRAME_SIZE’ was not declared in this scope

 ... is no longer defined in ffmpeg.

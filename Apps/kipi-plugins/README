Kipi Plugins are additional functions for the TDE Images Management
Host Programs (digikam, ksquirrel and gwenview).

exiv2, libkdcraw, libkexiv2, and libkipi are required to build Kipi Plugins.

Install exiv2, and build and install libkdcraw, libkexiv2, and libkipi
in that order.

The default build is for [US] English only - additional language support

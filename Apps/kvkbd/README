Known issues with Kvkbd are:

Where the shift character is not the upper case of the lower alpha character, the upper case character will be shown on the key.
For example, on the French azerty keyboard, Shift eacute should show as 2, but shows as Eacute.

Where the KeyPad '.' character on the Del key is mapped as a comma for a particular locale, it stills shows on the key as a period.

These are only problems with the characters displayed on the keys - the correct characters are printed.

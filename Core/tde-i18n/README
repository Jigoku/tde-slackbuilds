The source unpacked is ~950MB, so to save on build space, the
SlackBuild script extracts, builds, and removes source for each
language package one at a time.

Any number of packages can be built - set by the I18N variable

Language identification is shown in the 
'\Zb\Z3Select Additional Languages\Zn' screen README.

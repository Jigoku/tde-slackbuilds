There are issues building with cmake, so until they are resolved, the preference is an autotools build.
If you DO want to build with cmake, run 'USE_CMAKE_EDU=yes ./BUILD-TDE.sh'
kalzium won't build at all with cmake; it will with autotools, with limitations:

Re: configure output:
"""
The Kalzium Chemical Equation Solver has been disabled. Possible reasons of that:

* OCaml was not found. In order to have the Solver, you have to install OCaml. You can get OCaml from http://pauillac.inria.fr/ocaml/.

* The FaCiLe module for OCaml was not found. In order to have the Solver, you have to install the FaCiLe module. You can get it from http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/facile/.


Kig Python scripting support has been disabled, because you are missing the necessary headers and/or libraries.
In order to use Kig Python scripting, you need to have Python installed, along with its development package ( e.g. libpython-dev ), and also the Boost.Python library, along with its development package ( e.g. libboost-python-dev ).

Kig will continue to function without Python scripting support, but you will not be able to created Python scripted objects, or load Kig files that use them.

Installing the libraries:
The python development libraries themselves are almost certainly packaged by your favourite distribution.
Look for a package name like libpython-dev, with possibly a version number inserted somewhere in the name..
For the Boost.Python libs, check this documentation: "http://boost.org/more/download.html" and "http://boost.org/more/download.html#Installation"  or look for a package like libboost-python-dev or libboost-dev..

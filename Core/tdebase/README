Add this to  /etc/rc.d/rc.4 to start tdm

# Start TDM:
if [ -x /usr/bin/tdm ]; then
  exec /usr/bin/tdm -nodaemon
fi

If you installed with a different prefix than /usr then you need to
adjust the path to the tdm binary.

--------------------

Konqueror file manager as-built defaults to 'Icon View' when starting.
Setting 'Tree View' and saving that view profile should then default
to 'Tree View' when starting kfm or opening it in a new tab - the former
works but not the latter.

The problem seems to be that TDE lacks the entry in konquerorrc that exists in KDE3:
[MainView Settings]
ToggableViewsShown=konq_sidebartng
ViewMode=konq_treeview

Until this is sorted out in the source code, this hack works:

1] Start kfm to generate the ~/.trinity/share/config/konquerorrc file.

2] Close kfm

3] echo -e "\n\n[MainView Settings]\nViewMode=konq_treeview" >> ~/.trinity/share/config/konquerorrc

That's it.

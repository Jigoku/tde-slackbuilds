TDM

(Installing tdebase)
In line with normal practice, tdmrc will not be overwritten and tdmrc.new will be installed for admin decision on whether to use it as tdmrc. Where tdmrc doesn't exist, it will be created by doinst.sh from tdmrc.new.

(root logins)
AllowRootLogin is set to true in tdmrc.new, and will therefore be the default for new installations.

(rc.4.local)
This has been included on the assumption that the standard entry in rc.4[.new] from the package sysvinit-scripts exists:

    # If you'd like to start something different or in a
    # different order than the options below, create your
    # own startup script /etc/rc.d/rc.4.local and make it
    # executable and it will be used instead:
        if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.4.local ]; then
          exec /bin/bash /etc/rc.d/rc.4.local
        fi

To enable tdm if this isn't the case, either
[1] add this test to rc.4 above other session manager options
or
[2] copy the contents of rc.4.local to rc.4 above other session manager options

(Runlevel)
Set this to 4 and tdm should work out-of-the-box, especially for new installations.

------------------

(Konqueror file manager) as-built defaults to 'Icon View' when starting.
Setting 'another View' and saving that view profile should, but doesn't, override this.

The problem seems to be that TDE lacks the [MainView Settings] entry in konquerorrc that exists in KDE3.

Until this is fixed, to set 'Tree View' for example:

VIEWMODE=konq_treeview
sed -i "s|konq_iconview|$VIEWMODE|" /{TDE_installation_dir}/share/apps/konqueror/profiles/filemanagement
echo "[MainView Settings]
ViewMode=$VIEWMODE" > ~/.trinity/share/config/konquerorrc

The ViewMode options are:

konq_iconview
konq_multicolumnview
konq_treeview
konq_infolistview
konq_detailedlistview
konq_textview
fsview_part [File Size]

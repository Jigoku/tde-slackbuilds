 This is the set up script for TDE SlackBuilds on Slackware 14.2 for setting user preferences and options.
\n\n
 Source archives must be placed in the 'src' directory or will be downloaded during the build from a geoIP located mirror site.
\n\n
 A package build list is created and successfully built and installed packages are removed from that list as the build progresses.
\n\n
 US English is the default language and support for additional languages can be added.
\n\n
 There is an option to abort the build on the final setup screen - so just run through the options and familiarize yourself with them before an actual build. " \

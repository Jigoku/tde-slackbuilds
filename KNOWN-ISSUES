Not all mimetypes are detected. Files without extensions and things like slack-desc
have no default assosiations.
Anyone know fix? Besides just manually doing this in the settings after installing. 

TDM isn't working right at the moment. At least installed outside of /usr.
Will look in to this when I have more free time. My apologies.

Chalk crashes when trying to launch it. (At least for me) The rest of Koffice
seems to work fine.

Several things from the Apps dir aren't compiling with Clang. So even if you select to build 
with Clang, GCC is used. I will keep checking on these in future release and updates to Clang in Slackware

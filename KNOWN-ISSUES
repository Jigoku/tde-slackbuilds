1. After the first time you reboot after using TDE, you should open xwmconfig and reselect it. Your computer might freeze
otherwise =[ << though this may just be isolated to my computer (It hates GNU/Linux) D=
2. I briefly tried tdm and it wouldn't start any desktop environment. I mainly use runlevel 3 so I won't be looking into
this =[

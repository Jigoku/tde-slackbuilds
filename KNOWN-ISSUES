Not all mimetypes are detected. Files without extensions and things like slack-desc have no default associations.
Anyone know a fix? Besides just manually doing this in the settings after installing. 

Several things from the Apps dir aren't compiling with Clang. So even if you select to build 
with Clang, GCC is used. I will keep checking on these in future release and updates to Clang in Slackware

If you have Slackware's KDE installed and TDE as well. You might have an issue with TDE launching 
the KDE4 Konsole and attempting to use it's ark. To fix please adjust your $PATH so that the TDE
directory comes before /usr/share/bin.

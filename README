THIS WILL MOST LIKELY INTERFERE WITH KDE

The build order is listed in each folder. Build the 3rdparty-deps first, then Deps,
then the Core.

3rdparty-deps are required with how I have these built. You can view the very short list 
in the folder and get them from SBo for now. Well krb5 you can probably do without. 
Maybe avahi as well if you feel like editing the build scripts.

Has build scripts that automate the build process

I'm running Slackware Current. So these are untested on Stable. 

Freetype issue I was having has been fixed, Thank you AlienBob!

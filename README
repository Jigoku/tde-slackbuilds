This isn't complete but it runs well =D 
I may wait for the next release before compiling the rest of the apps.

3rdparty-deps are required with how I have these built. You can view the very short list in the folder 
and get them from SBo for now. Well krb5 you can probably do without. Maybe avahi as well if you feel 
like editing the build scripts.

The build order is listed in each folder. Build the 3rdparty-deps first, then Deps, then the Core. 

I'm running Slackware Current. So these are untested on Stable. 

I'm not running KDE 4, don't know if this will screw with anything or not from it.

freetype issue I was having has been fixed, Thank you AlienBob!

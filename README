This is as complete as it's getting =D 
For now anyways. May add more with next release, if more has been switched to using cmake

3rdparty-deps are required with how I have these built. You can view the very short list in the folder 
and get them from SBo for now. Well krb5 you can probably do without. Maybe avahi as well if you feel 
like editing the build scripts.

The build order is listed in each folder. Build the 3rdparty-deps first, then Deps, then the Core. 
Now has build scripts that automate the build process

I'm running Slackware Current. So these are untested on Stable. 

I'm not running KDE 4, don't know if this will screw with anything or not from it.

freetype issue I was having has been fixed, Thank you AlienBob!

Run ./BUILD-TDE.sh - a dialog based script with a series of screens for user input.

=============================================================

Any package, or set of packages, can be built by running BUILD-TDE.sh and selecting them from the 'TDE Packages Selection' screen.
The TDE mandatory packages can be pre-selected.
Some packages also require other packages to be pre-installed - see notes at the bottom of the dialog screen.

The directory structure for the SlackBuild scripts is in line with the Trinity source repositories:
Deps [dependencies/]
Core []
Libs [libraries/]
Apps [applications/]

Other directories are:
Misc - for non-Trinity package builds
src - to hold all the source tarballs, either pre-downloaded or downloaded during the build.

Other scripts:
get-source.sh - a chunk of common code for the SBs - used for getting the source archive, setting FLAGS, creating build directories.

There is an override in the SB for non-trinity source archive URLs. Non-trinity builds have been included where a TDE package requires a dependency that is not in Slackware Current. Or, where it might be an alternative to a TDE package.

Required packages for a basic working TDE are:
  Deps/tqt3
  Deps/tqtinterface
  Deps/arts
  Deps/dbus-tqt
  Deps/dbus-1-tqt
  Deps/tqca-tls
  Deps/libart_lgpl
  Core/tdelibs
  Core/tdebase

i18n support [locale and html/help docs] in the packages is restricted to whatever is selected in BUILD-TDE.sh and, of that, to whatever is available in the package source.

See https://wiki.trinitydesktop.org/How_to_Build_TDE_Core_Modules for more information

=========================================================
NOTE: The Misc directory contains SlackBuilds for software you might already have from slackbuilds.org or elsewhere.
Please check to see if you have them or not already if you can't remember for sure. If you already have them
there is no need to select them to be compiled and built. Though you can do this anyways if you want to replace the
ones you have, but there is no need for this.

***Please be sure to read the KNOWN-ISSUES file prior to building.***

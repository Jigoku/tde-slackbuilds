Build TDE [Trinity Desktop Environment] for Slackware 14.2 and current** on i586+, x86_64, or Raspberry Pi3 [see README-Raspberry-Pi3.md].

Run ./BUILD-TDE.sh - a dialog based script with a series of screens for user input.

=============================================================

Any package, or set of packages, can be built by running BUILD-TDE.sh and selecting them from the 'TDE Packages Selection' screen.
The TDE mandatory packages can be pre-selected.
Some packages also require other packages to be pre-installed - see notes at the bottom of the dialog screen.

The directory structure for the SlackBuild scripts is in line with the Trinity source repositories:
Deps [dependencies/]
Core []
Libs [libraries/]
Apps [applications/]

Other directories are:
Misc - for non-Trinity package builds
src - to hold all the source tarballs, either pre-downloaded or downloaded during the build.

Other scripts:
get-source.sh - a chunk of common code for the SBs - used for getting the source archive, setting FLAGS, creating build directories.

There is an override in the SB for non-trinity source archive URLs. Non-trinity builds have been included where a TDE package requires a dependency that is not in Slackware Current. Or, where it might be an alternative to a TDE package.

Required packages for a basic working TDE are:
  Deps/tqt3
  Deps/tqtinterface
  Deps/arts
  Deps/dbus-tqt
  Deps/dbus-1-tqt
  Deps/tqca-tls
  Deps/libart_lgpl
  Core/tdelibs
  Core/tdebase

i18n support [locale and html/help docs] in the packages is restricted to whatever is selected in BUILD-TDE.sh and, of that, to whatever is available in the package source.

TDM may need some manual setting up - see Core/tdebase/README, which can also be viewed while running BUILD-TDE.sh if tdebase is selected.

=========================================================

NOTE: The Misc directory contains SlackBuilds for software that might already be installed from slackbuilds.org or elsewhere.
Please check because any misc builds selected here could overwrite them.

** Not tested on current since the Mass Rebuild of 2018-04-19. **

***Please be sure to read the KNOWN-ISSUES file prior to building.***

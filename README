This isn't complete but it runs well =D 
I may wait for the next release before compiling the rest of the apps.

3rdparty-deps are required with how I have these built. You can view the very short list in the folder 
and get them from SBo for now. Well krb5 you can probably do without. Maybe avahi as well if you feel 
like editing the build scripts.

The build order is listed in each folder. Build the 3rdparty-deps first, then Deps, then the Core. 

I'm running Slackware Current. So these are untested on Stable. 

I'm not running KDE 4, don't know if this will screw with anything or not from it.

# One more thing thats pretty important: 

I had to symlink the header files from /usr/include/freetype2 to /usr/include
then create a folder in /usr/include called config and then symlink the contents of 
/usr/include/freetype2/config to it.

This was to get tqt3 to compile. Please help me get around this in the tqt3 SlackBuild if you know how
There should be someway I can point to the correct directory or export it or something but I don't
know how.

# Heres what I did.

ln -sv /usr/include/freetype2/*.h /usr/include

mkdir -v /usr/include/config

ln -sv /usr/include/freetype2/config/*.h /usr/include/config
